üöÄ Simple Flutter Authcheck Project
Welcome to the Simple Flutter Authcheck Project! This project is your gateway to understanding how to build robust authentication systems with multiple user roles in Flutter. It's a fantastic starting point for anyone looking to implement role-based access control using Firebase Authentication for secure user management and Firestore for dynamic user profiles and data storage.

This project is designed to be a clear, comprehensive example of how to handle different user types seamlessly within a single Flutter application.

‚ú® Key Features You'll Explore
Firebase Authentication: Effortlessly handle user registration and login with secure email and password authentication.

Firestore Integration: Store and retrieve user-specific data, including their assigned roles, directly from a powerful NoSQL database.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Intelligently direct users to specific pages or functionalities based on their pre-defined roles (e.g., Admin, Regular User, Viewer).

Separate User Interfaces: Discover how to create distinct, tailored user experiences with different pages or layouts for each stakeholder type.

Ready to dive in? Follow these simple steps to get this project up and running on your machine.

Prerequisites
Before we start, make sure you have these essentials:

Flutter SDK: If you haven't already, install Flutter ‚Äì it's super easy!

Firebase CLI: Get the Firebase Command Line Interface for seamless Firebase project interactions.

Firebase Project Setup
This project heavily relies on Firebase for its backend. Let's get it configured:

Create Your Firebase Project:

Head over to the Firebase Console.

Click "Add project" and follow the prompts to create a brand new Firebase project.

Connect Your Flutter App to Firebase:

Inside your new Firebase project, register your Flutter app by adding a new web app, Android app, and iOS app.

Carefully follow the on-screen instructions to register your app and download the crucial configuration files:

For Android: Place google-services.json into your android/app/ directory.

For iOS: Place GoogleService-Info.plist into your ios/Runner/ directory.

For Web: You'll receive a configuration snippet; you'll typically use this when initializing Firebase in your main.dart or a dedicated Firebase config file.

Enable Email/Password Authentication: Navigate to "Authentication" -> "Sign-in method" in the Firebase Console and enable "Email/Password."

Set Up Cloud Firestore: Create a Cloud Firestore database. For this project, starting in "Production mode" is recommended for better security.

Installation
Almost there! Now, let's get the code onto your machine:

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/authcheck.git
cd authcheck

(Remember to replace your-username with your actual GitHub username or the repository's path.)

Install Dependencies:

flutter pub get

This command fetches all the necessary packages defined in pubspec.yaml.

Run the Application:

flutter run

And voil√†! Your Flutter Authcheck project should now be running.
