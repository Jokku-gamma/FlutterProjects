Simple Flutter Authcheck Project
This project is a starting point for a Flutter application designed to demonstrate a basic authentication system with multiple user roles, utilizing Firebase Authentication for user management and Firestore for storing user profiles and roles. It's ideal for understanding how to implement role-based access control in a Flutter application.

Getting Started
This project aims to provide a simple yet comprehensive example of handling different user types within a single Flutter application.

Key Features
Firebase Authentication: Secure user registration and login using email and password.

Firestore Integration: Store user-specific data, including their assigned role, in Firestore.

Role-Based Access Control: Direct users to specific pages based on their assigned role (e.g., Admin, Regular User, Viewer).

Separate User Interfaces: Distinct pages or layouts for each stakeholder type.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Flutter SDK: Install Flutter

Firebase CLI: Install Firebase CLI

Firebase Project Setup
Create a Firebase Project:

Go to the Firebase Console.

Click "Add project" and follow the instructions to create a new project.

Add Flutter App to Firebase:

In your Firebase project, add a new web app, Android app, and iOS app.

Follow the instructions to register your app and download the configuration files:

For Android: google-services.json (place it in android/app/)

For iOS: GoogleService-Info.plist (place it in ios/Runner/)

For Web: Configuration snippet (will be used in your main.dart or a separate Firebase config file).

Enable Email/Password authentication in the Firebase Console under "Authentication" -> "Sign-in method".

Create a Cloud Firestore database. Start in "Production mode" for better security.
